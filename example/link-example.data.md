### Linking Example

This file is intended to help learn about text linking with slate.

When linking, one item is marked with an underline, and another is marked with
green text. At the moment, the top line should be both green and highlighted.

  >- Try moving the green line down by pressing SHIFT + DOWN (OS X only) or 'o'.
  >-  Now try moving it up with SHIFT + UP (OS X only) or 'i'.

Move the green line down a few lines and try moving the highlighted line with
UP and DOWN. Note that the highlighted line cannot go below the green line.

  >> Try creating a link by typing SHIFT + d (i.e. D).

Note that once linked, the text turns blue.

  >> Try removing the link by typing SHIFT + d again.
  >> Now re-create the link with 'd'.

Note that when typing lowercase 'd', at the same time as creating the link, the
green line is moved down one and the highlighted line is changed to be right
above it.

  >> Move the green line back up one
  >> Link a second line to this one using SHIFT + d
  >> Now press 'u' to undo all links for this line
  >> Hide the help information at the bottom by typing 'h'

To search for text, type a '\' and the text you want to search for. Press ENTER
and then n or p to go to the next or previous occurrence.

Do not do it yet, but you can move between files in your list with '.' and ','. Any
annotations will be saved when you change files, and recovered when you return.
To quit, type 'q'.
